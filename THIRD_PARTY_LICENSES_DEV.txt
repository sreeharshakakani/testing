      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and 
Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") 
of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of 
contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public 
can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in 
other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any 
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the 
Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and 
scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the 
use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional 
consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the 
extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects 
to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or 
her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on 
those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and 
related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in 
paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national 
implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or 
treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, 
Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and 
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of 
action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of 
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by 
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium 
and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation 
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the 
benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and 
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, 
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of 
the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid 
or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent 
permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent 
the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non 
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise 
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the 
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in 
any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, 
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The 
License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should 
any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable 
law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, 
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her 
remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes 
of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of 
Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or 
otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning 
the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of 
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of 
latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not 
discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work 
or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the 
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions 
or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has 
no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE 
("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF 
THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS 
OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS 
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, 
such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a 
literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or 
any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form 
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not 
be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the 
Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation 
with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and 
anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than 
works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their 
contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in 
unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and 
independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that 
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes 
of this License.
c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or 
Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under 
the terms of this License.
e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, 
individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be 
identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, 
musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or 
otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a 
phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance 
or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the 
broadcast.
f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including 
without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be 
the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other 
writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or 
dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition 
with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process 
analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or 
lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to 
photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work 
relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a 
phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work 
performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary 
or artistic work.
g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously 
violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission 
from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the 
public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or 
public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of 
the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to 
perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the 
performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the 
Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound 
or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including 
storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses 
free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in 
connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a 
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) 
license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce 
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation 
in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that 
changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original 
work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work 
has been modified.";
c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
e. For the avoidance of doubt:
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect 
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor 
reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights 
granted under this License;
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect 
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives 
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under 
this License; and,
iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether 
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that 
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights 
granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. 
The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to 
exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly 
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by 
the following restrictions:
a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must 
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of 
the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that 
restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the 
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. 
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties 
with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly 
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict 
the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient 
under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a 
Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject 
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, 
to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as 
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent 
practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, 
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the 
Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original 
Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor 
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for 
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other 
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) 
to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated 
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for 
the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit 
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by 
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required 
by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the 
case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all 
contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in 
a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance 
of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in 
the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly 
or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original 
Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, 
without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or 
Attribution Parties.
c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by 
applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as 
part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other 
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor 
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of 
the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed 
to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original 
Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, 
to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably 
exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not 
otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND 
MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY 
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE 
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL 
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE 
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by 
You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or 
Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided 
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the 
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the 
right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any 
time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any 
other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and 
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to 
the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You 
under this License.
b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a 
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under 
this License.
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not 
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without 
further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless 
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver 
or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the 
Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear 
in any communication from You.
e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted 
utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works 
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, 
the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as 
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction 
in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of 
the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite 
of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this 
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not 
intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
